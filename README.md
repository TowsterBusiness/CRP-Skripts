Note: This guide shows you how to set up and configure a Minecraft Server. However, doing this requires changing your home network's configuration and is not recommended unless you know what you are doing. If you wish to purchase a small private server for friends, check out Minecraft Realms. If you still wish to set up your own private server, do so at your own risk as we cannot offer support for home networks or privately made servers. 

Here is a guide to help you create a server so your friends can join and play together!

2. After you have downloaded it, make a folder on your desktop to keep all your server files in. You can name it “Minecraft Server”. 
3. Drag over or copy and paste the .jar file into the Minecraft Server folder.

7. You can find the directory in Windows by simply clicking on the browser directory in file browser here. blobid0.png(The theme and color of your file browser will appear different due to your personalization settings)
